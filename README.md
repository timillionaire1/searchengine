PROJECT TITLE:Search Engine
PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
A search engine is software accessed on the Internet that searches a database of information according to the user's query. The engine provides a list of results that best match what the user is trying to find.

How a search engine works:
Because large search engines contain millions and sometimes billions of pages, many search engines display the results depending on their importance. This importance is commonly determined using various algorithms.
As illustrated, the source of all search engine data is collected using a spider or crawler that visits each page on the Internet and collects its information.
Once a page is crawled, the data contained in the page is processed and indexed.The data collected is used to rank each page. These rankings then determine which pages to show in the search results and in what order.
Finally, once the data is processed, it's broken up into files, inserted into a database, or loaded into memory, where it's accessed when a search is performed.
